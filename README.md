# Steroid_Degradation_Metagenomes_MAGs_2017

Metagenome associated genomes (MAGs) were recovered using MyCC (Lin and Liao, Accurate binning of metagenomic contigs via automated clustering sequences using information of genomic signatures and marker genes. Sci Rep (2016) doi:10.1038/srep24175) and MAG quality was assessed using CheckM (Donovan et al., CheckM: assessing the quality of microbial genomes recovered from isolates, single cells, and metagenomes. Genome Res (2015) doi:10.1101/gr.186072.114). Steroid dergadation capacity of MAGs was assessed using 23 hidden Markov models (HMMs) representing 10 key protein families of aerobic bacterial steroid degradation.
